## Connection Specific Parameters

1. Connection Interval:

    - If longer the interval, than the radio has to be switched ON less time.
    Cons: Latency will be high. Time taken for data transfer

1. Slave Latency:

    - The slave has no need to respond for each messages. So the Rx port of the receiver is sapred.
    Cons: Only timeout can detect and ti will be longer

1. PHY:

    - If 2M PHY is used, the TX time is shorter.
    Cons: Compactablity.

1. Coded PHY:

    - More power consumption, but more range and reliablity

1. Tx Power: 

    - Less TX power means less consumption

1. Crystal Settings:

    - When the crystal is not accurate enough, the device has to wake up earlier
